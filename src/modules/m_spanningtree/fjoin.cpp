/** FJOIN, almost identical to TS6 SJOIN, except for nicklist handling. */
CmdResult CommandFJoin::Handle(User* srcuser, std::vector<std::string>& params)
{
	/* 1.1+ FJOIN works as follows:
	 *
	 * Each FJOIN is sent along with a timestamp, and the side with the lowest
	 * timestamp 'wins'. From this point on we will refer to this side as the
	 * winner. The side with the higher timestamp loses, from this point on we
	 * will call this side the loser or losing side. This should be familiar to
	 * anyone who's dealt with dreamforge or TS6 before.
	 *
	 * When two sides of a split heal and this occurs, the following things
	 * will happen:
	 *
	 * If the timestamps are exactly equal, both sides merge their privilages
	 * and users, as in InspIRCd 1.0 and ircd2.8. The channels have not been
	 * re-created during a split, this is safe to do.
	 *
	 * If the timestamps are NOT equal, the losing side removes all of its
	 * modes from the channel, before introducing new users into the channel
	 * which are listed in the FJOIN command's parameters. The losing side then
	 * LOWERS its timestamp value of the channel to match that of the winning
	 * side, and the modes of the users of the winning side are merged in with
	 * the losing side.
	 *
	 * The winning side on the other hand will ignore all user modes from the
	 * losing side, so only its own modes get applied. Life is simple for those
	 * who succeed at internets. :-)
	 *
	 * Syntax:
	 * :<sid> FJOIN <chan> <TS> <modes> :[<member> [<member> ...]]
	 * The last parameter is a list consisting of zero or more channel members
	 * (permanent channels may have zero users). Each entry on the list is in the
	 * following format:
	 * [[<modes>,]<uuid>[:<membid>]
	 * <modes> is a concatenation of the mode letters the user has on the channel
	 * (e.g.: "ov" if the user is opped and voiced). The order of the mode letters
	 * are not important but if a server ecounters an unknown mode letter, it will
	 * drop the link to avoid desync.
	 *
	 * InspIRCd 2.0 and older required a comma before the uuid even if the user
	 * had no prefix modes on the channel, InspIRCd 2.2 and later does not require
	 * a comma in this case anymore.
	 *
	 * <membid> is a positive integer representing the id of the membership.
	 * If not present (in FJOINs coming from pre-1205 servers), 0 is assumed.
	 *
